This weather app, built using Python with Django, seamlessly integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver accurate weather forecasts. The frontend, crafted with HTML and CSS, ensures an intuitive user experience. Users can input their desired city, triggering a backend process that retrieves weather data from OpenWeatherMap. This data is dynamically displayed on the frontend, providing users with current weather conditions, including temperature and description, alongside an illustrative weather icon. Through this cohesive integration of frontend and backend technologies, users can conveniently access up-to-date weather information for any location, enhancing their daily planning and decision-making processes
